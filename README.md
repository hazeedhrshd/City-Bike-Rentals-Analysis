It contains detailed information about city bike rentals, including rental duration, user demographics, rental locations, and timestamps. Please note that all data in this analysis is anonymized and does not include any sensitive information.

The dataset includes the following attributes:

- `start_datetime`: The start date and time of the bike rental.
- `end_datetime`: The end date and time of the bike rental.
- `start_station`: The station where the bike rental started.
- `end_station`: The station where the bike rental ended.
- `start_coordinates`: The latitude and longitude coordinates of the start station.
- `end_coordinates`: The latitude and longitude coordinates of the end station.
- `birth_year`: The birth year of the bike renter.
- `gender`: The gender of the bike renter .
- `ride_type`: The type of bike ride.

Please note that all data in this analysis is anonymized and does not include any sensitive information.

## Tableau Dashboards

The analysis is presented through interactive Tableau dashboards, providing a user-friendly and visually engaging way to explore the data. The dashboards offer insights into the following key aspects of city bike rentals:

### 1. Rental Trends and Patterns

- Visualize rental patterns over time, such as hourly, daily, or monthly trends.
- Identify peak rental hours and days.
- Explore the average rental duration and the distribution of rental durations.

### 2. User Demographics and Usage

- Analyze user demographics, including age groups (derived from birth year), and gender distribution.
- Understand user preferences and rental habits.

### 3. Rental Locations and Popularity

- View popular rental locations on a map using the start and end coordinates.
- Identify frequently used stations and visualize rental volumes at different stations.
